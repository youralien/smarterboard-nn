###Dropout
* Useful for big, complex nets that overfit.  Must determine if the current net has high-variance (overfitting) or high-bias (underfitting) on the training data
* how to create a "mean net" with dropout [https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/119]
	* are weights being halved in foxhound?
* can't control dropout for Input layer.
